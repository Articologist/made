## How it works

üê¢üöÄ This is a Node.js app! It's powered by:

- [Replicate](https://replicate.com/), a platform for running machine learning models in the cloud.
- [InstructPix2Pix](https://replicate.com/cjwbw/instruct-pix2pix-diffuser/api), an open-source machine learning model that generates images from an image and a text prompt.
- Next.js [server-side API routes](pages/api) for talking to the Replicate API
- Next.js React components for the inpainting GUI
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling
- [Lucide](https://lucide.dev/) for Icons
